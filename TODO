## my_dbg TODO

portability:
    [ ] 32bits elf support

debug symbols:
    [ ] use .debug_abbrev section to fill dw_table

interaction:
    [ ] Ctrl-C stops current instruction if in interactive mode
        and send sigstop to tracee if not

commands:
    [ ] add pid argument to break
    [ ] argument N to singlestep and next_instr
    [ ] negative argument to list
    [ ] follow fork mode
    [ ] checkpoint / restore
    [ ] Stop using unw_step: segv when beeing on top of the call stack

breakpoints:
    [ ] completion on breakf
    [ ] Break on syscall before plt relocation
        [ ] Search missing symbols offset in shared library and wait
            break r_debug to hit to put the breakpoint ourself
